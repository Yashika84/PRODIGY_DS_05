This repository contains my submission for Task 05 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech.

The goal of this task is to perform a comprehensive analysis of traffic accident data**, understand the factors influencing accident severity, and create visualizations that uncover patterns related to time, cause, weather, light, vehicle type, and more.
Through this task, I explored the dataset using Python and generated various plots such as bar charts, horizontal bar plots , and heatmaps to understand how accidents vary based on conditions and human behavior.


# Objectives

- Analyze traffic accident data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understand accident severity distribution
- Identify top causes and environmental contributors
- Visualize relationships between vehicle type, weather, light, and severity



#  Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook


# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Data Cleaning:
- Removed irrelevant columns like `Time`, `Service_year_of_vehicle`, and `Fitness_of_casuality`
- Handled missing or inconsistent entries
- Encoded categorical variables where necessary
- Checked and dropped null values for clean analysis

# Key Insights

### 1. Most Frequent Cause of Accidents
- `No Distancing` was the leading cause of accidents, highlighting the lack of space between vehicles.
- Lane changes and careless driving were also top contributors.
- Emphasizes need for driver behavior improvement and awareness campaigns.

### 2. Accidents by Day of the Week
- Friday recorded the highest number of accidents, likely due to weekend rush.
- Most weekday traffic accidents occurred between Tuesday and Thursday.
- Sundays and Mondays saw fewer incidents, indicating lighter traffic volumes.

### 3. Environmental Conditions
- Most accidents occurred in normal weather, showing that driver error—not weather—is the main cause.
- Rainy and foggy conditions still showed a moderate accident count.
- Daylight** was the most common light condition, followed by night without light, which had a higher severity rate.

### 4. Vehicle Type Analysis
- Automobiles were the most involved in accidents.
- Used a horizontal bar plot to visualize accident counts by vehicle type.
- Heavy vehicles were less frequent but possibly more severe in outcome.

# Summary

This traffic analysis reveals that human error and carelessness are the dominant factors behind road accidents — more than weather or infrastructure. Visualizations helped in highlighting patterns such as:
- Risky driving habits like no distancing and careless lane changes
- Increased accident frequency on Fridays and weekdays
- Higher severity at night and during poor light conditions.

Through this task, I gained hands-on experience in  Real-world data preprocessing and cleaning along with exploring complex categorical variables Building effective visualizations using Seaborn & MatplotlibDeriving actionable insights from transportation-related datasets
This project helped me appreciate how data can guide road safety strategies, shape policy decisions, and improve public awareness regarding safe driving habits.

Thank you for reviewing my work!
